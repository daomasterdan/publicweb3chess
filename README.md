Please note!

This scripts.js file is simply for demonstration purposes.

Due to the nature of our codebase, we've had to obscure certain parts.

Our codebase includes several .js, .css, .html and .sol files to handle game logic, client/server side logic, UI customisations and solidity/transaction logic.

We're very proud of our work and are happy to share more specific parts of the code when requested.
