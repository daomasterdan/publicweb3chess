Please note!

This scripts.js file is simply for hackathon demonstration purposes in order to help judges determine the authenticity of our code.

Due to the nature of our codebase, we've had to obscure most of it for IP reasons.

Our codebase includes several .js, .css, .html and .sol files to handle game logic, client/server side logic, UI customisations and solidity/transaction logic.

We're very proud of our work and are happy to share more specific parts of the code when requested.
